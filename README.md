# 🚀 Smart Reminder – Android Application (Java | Android Studio)

I have developed a small but very useful Android application named Smart Reminder using Java in Android Studio.

✨ Key Features:
🔐 Easy login system with Email + 5-digit PIN
📧 Secure Email & Password storage
📸 Screenshots storage feature
🔁 Forgot PIN? No worries! Reset easily via OTP sent to Email
⚡ Simple, lightweight & user-friendly interface

This app is designed to be simple yet practical, focusing on daily usability and security.
A great learning experience in Android development, authentication, OTP handling, and local storage.

💡 Always learning & building!
Feedback is welcome 😊
